Webxygen: an advanced Web site generator
Summary:
Webxygen is a software which is intended to host many web sites within a common advanced framework. Our aim is to include and concentrate as many ''intelligent'' features as possible into a single software, Webxygen (which stands for ''WEB SIte GENerator''). All web sites hosted by Webxygen automatically inherit those advanced features.
Here is a sample of Webxygen's features which are actually implemented:
Administration: distant from any browser, multi-author and multi-administrators,
Users rights: login/pwd with different rights allowing to view or not pages or medias, managing extranets,
Usage analyzis: automatic analyzis of users behaviors (basic statistics on hits and sessions, advanced techniques involving cookies, clustering and datamining algorithms)
Dynamic adaptation to users: recording user actions, automatic thematic profiling, suggesting related pages in real time,
Styles: dynamic changes of site styles (for visually impaired people for instance, pages can be made more readable),
Forums/discusion groups: automatic management of discussion/exchange forums,
Languages: multi-lingual management of pages and medias.
