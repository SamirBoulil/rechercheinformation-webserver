Research activities of the N&N Group
Our research themes can be summed up as follows:
we study population-based biomimetic algorithms, namely Genetic Algorithms and Artificial Ants, and stochastic algorithms such as Hidden Markov Models
we apply those algorithms to learning and optimization problems centered on the Web
we make use of Virtual Reality as an interactive visualization tool
Web applications Genetic Algorithms
Artificial Ants Hidden Markov Models
Virtual Reality
