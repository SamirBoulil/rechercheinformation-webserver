Modelling the ants chemical recognition system & Clustering
Summary:
We introduce in this work a new method for the unsupervised clustering problem, relying on a modelling of the ants chemical recognition system. The latter provides ants with the ability to discriminate between nestmates and intruders, and thus to create homogeneous groups of individuals sharing a similar odor by continuously exchanging chemical cues. This phenomenon, known as "colonial closure", gives us the idea to developp a new clustering algorithm and then to compare it to a well-known method such as K-Means method. Our results show that our algorithm performs better than K-Means over artificial and real data sets, and furthermore our approach requires less initial informations (such as number of classes, shape of classes, limitation in the types of attributes handled).
